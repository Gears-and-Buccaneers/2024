<br>this is the code for 2024 and will be populated
https://gears-and-buccaneers.github.io/2024RobotCode/

This is testing for 2024. it has advantage scope and unit test.

was also messing around with formating the joystics and motor controllers
<?in my mind util should be something that can jsut be copied and pasted year to year. (implementing updates and stuff but not major changes)

EDIT: testing isues
